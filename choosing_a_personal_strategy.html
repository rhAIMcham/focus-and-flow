        const strategySummaries = {
            "Clarify goals and structure work blocks": "Clarifying goals and structuring work blocks involves breaking down large, ambiguous tasks into specific, manageable objectives with clear success criteria. This strategy helps reduce cognitive load by eliminating uncertainty about what needs to be accomplished and when. When you define precise goals for each work session, you create a roadmap that guides your attention and allows you to assess progress more easily. Structured work blocks—dedicated time periods assigned to specific tasks—prevent multitasking and task-switching that fragment focus. This approach also leverages the psychological benefits of completion, as finishing defined blocks provides motivation and momentum. Consider using techniques like SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) to frame your objectives, and experiment with different block lengths to find what sustains your focus best.",
            
            "Seek out feedback/clear communication": "Seeking feedback and maintaining clear communication creates conditions for flow by reducing ambiguity and providing the information needed to adjust performance in real-time. Flow states require knowing whether you're on track, and regular feedback loops—whether from colleagues, mentors, or self-assessment—help maintain this awareness. Clear communication prevents the frustration and distraction that comes from misaligned expectations or unclear requirements. This strategy involves actively asking clarifying questions, establishing regular check-ins with stakeholders, creating channels for immediate feedback when needed, and being explicit about your own needs and constraints. Good communication also includes setting boundaries around availability and response times, which protects focus time while ensuring necessary collaboration continues smoothly.",
            
            "Create a routine that matches your rhythms": "Creating routines aligned with your natural rhythms involves designing your daily schedule to match your biological and psychological patterns of energy, focus, and motivation. Everyone experiences predictable fluctuations in alertness, creativity, and concentration throughout the day based on circadian rhythms, sleep patterns, meal timing, and individual chronotypes (whether you're a morning person or night person). By observing when you naturally feel most focused, creative, or energetic, you can strategically schedule different types of work to match these states. This might mean protecting morning hours for deep analytical work, using post-lunch dips for administrative tasks, or scheduling creative brainstorming when you feel most mentally flexible. Consistent routines also reduce decision fatigue and create psychological cues that help you transition into focus mode more easily.",
            
            "Manage energy and incorporate rest": "Managing energy and incorporating rest recognizes that sustained focus depends not just on willpower but on physical and mental resources that need regular replenishment. This strategy involves treating rest as an essential component of productivity rather than a luxury or weakness. Effective energy management includes scheduling regular breaks during work sessions, ensuring adequate sleep, staying properly hydrated and nourished, incorporating physical movement, and taking longer recovery periods between intensive work phases. Research shows that strategic rest actually improves performance—breaks allow for memory consolidation, creative incubation, and restoration of attention. This approach requires overriding cultural messages that glorify constant busyness and instead embracing the reality that human cognitive capacity is finite and renewable. The key is being intentional about rest rather than waiting until exhaustion forces it.",
            
            "Manage environment distractions": "Managing environmental distractions involves deliberately designing your physical workspace and surroundings to minimize interruptions and support sustained attention. This includes controlling noise through headphones, white noise, or quiet spaces; managing visual distractions by organizing your workspace and removing unnecessary items from view; optimizing lighting to reduce eye strain and support alertness; and controlling temperature for comfort. Environmental management also means considering the presence of tempting distractions—phones, social media, snacks, or other people—and creating physical or digital barriers to these during focus time. Small changes like closing unnecessary browser tabs, using website blockers, turning off notifications, or placing your phone out of sight can significantly reduce the mental effort required to maintain focus. The goal is creating an environment that makes focused work the path of least resistance.",
            
            "Use attention anchors e.g. mindfulness practice": "Using attention anchors like mindfulness practice involves cultivating techniques that help you notice when your mind wanders and gently redirect focus back to the task at hand. Mindfulness—paying attention to the present moment without judgment—strengthens the mental muscles needed for sustained concentration. Regular practice, even just a few minutes daily, improves your ability to catch distractions early and return to focus more quickly. Attention anchors can include formal meditation, breathing exercises, body scans, or simply bringing full awareness to routine activities. During work, you might use periodic check-ins where you pause to notice your mental state and re-commit to your current task. This strategy also includes developing awareness of your typical distraction patterns and internal signals of wandering attention, allowing you to intervene before losing significant focus time.",
            
            "Find motivation/curiosity/purpose/passion": "Finding motivation, curiosity, purpose, and passion involves connecting your work to intrinsic drivers that naturally sustain engagement and focus. Flow states emerge most readily when we're doing activities we find inherently interesting or meaningful. This strategy requires reflection on what aspects of your work genuinely interest you, how your tasks connect to larger purposes you care about, what problems ignite your curiosity, and where you can find or create opportunities for passion. Sometimes this means reframing tasks to emphasize their meaningful elements, seeking projects that align with your values, or finding the intellectually interesting puzzles within routine work. When intrinsic motivation is present, focus becomes effortless because your attention is naturally drawn to the task rather than requiring willpower to maintain. Consider regularly asking yourself 'What makes this interesting?' or 'How does this matter?' to strengthen these connections.",
            
            "Find risk/novelty/creativity/challenge": "Finding risk, novelty, creativity, and challenge involves seeking the optimal level of difficulty that keeps you engaged without becoming overwhelming. Flow states occur in the sweet spot between boredom and anxiety—when tasks are challenging enough to demand full attention but not so difficult that they create stress. This strategy means actively looking for ways to make work more engaging: taking on stretch assignments, finding creative approaches to routine tasks, setting personal challenges beyond minimum requirements, or exploring novel methods and perspectives. The element of risk—the possibility of failure or the unknown—can heighten focus by increasing stakes in a motivating way. However, this requires calibration; too much difficulty causes anxiety that disrupts flow, while too little causes boredom and mind-wandering. Regularly adjusting task difficulty to match your growing capabilities helps maintain this optimal challenge zone."
